I was doing multitasking. So did you get all the answers that we want for moving forward on this? I believe so, right. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I think there's some things up in the air, but yeah, absolutely. I think, I think we have, yeah. Okay. And I was thinking between Vikas and Kush, we can probably put a composition together. So that will also address what Chitra was asking yesterday. What do you, what do you feel on that? Sorry. I have pulled in everyone so that we can have a quick conversation as well. Right. Maybe I'm a little bit confused on who is going to do what. Sorry. I thought Vikas was ING. So but now Vikas is over here. Vikas is my guy. Vikas is my guy. Chitra, I just quickly wanted a debrief on the last conversation. So just we know what to do next. We'll just literally take two minutes, right? So what I'm proposing is, I think I want to propose, Kush, I think Thomas is aware of, Kush and Vikas, two one plus one combination will onboard. And they will work under guidance of yourself, Thomas and Chitra. That's how we'll take it forward. And I'll aim to onboard both of them potentially by the following Monday. Not this Monday, the following Monday. That's a target we can keep. Major call out, Shiv. Does that make sense for everybody? There's some background noise, but yeah, absolutely. No, no, this is good for me. So there. Right. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So when you say Kush, right, that's one AI engineer, right? Who's going to be the second AI engineer? So that's my partly a mandate for Vikas, partly also a question for you. So what I have done is I have requested all my engineers to be trained on GNI. They have also learned this and got themselves certified. So I want Vikas also to get hands-on onto that. That's one mandate he has. But at the same time, one person comes with a GNI, one comes with the GNI learned acquired skills. So that one plus one combination is what I'm thinking of. So with the minimal guidance from around the system, they should be able to move forward. Do you think that's workable? I think it should be workable. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I'll do some engineering myself as well. I guide them, show them what good really looks like, but make sure really that they get up to speed as well so they can work independently as well. Yeah, absolutely. The idea is to make it a little scalable so that otherwise we will all become bottlenecked in every situation. Exactly. Do you have a kind of a typical Scrum Master setup as well, Sudhir? Not exactly. So in ING world, the squad leads themselves, drive the Scrum Mastery role. But what I suggest is probably Vikas can play that role here for this particular track. Okay, good. Vikas, you've done that before? Yeah, Scrum Master. Okay, good. Fantastic. So you can facilitate the sprints and ceremonies and the different kind of in the backlog and maintain that one as well. Okay, good. And we've got access to Jira, right, Vikas? Yeah. So in ING, we don't use Jira. So where do we want to track the progress? We use Azure DevBoard in ING. So probably because as soon as you're onboarded, try to create one separate instance for Azure DevBoard for this particular project itself. Using ADO, yeah? Yeah, Azure DevBoard. Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay, that's good. That works as well. Okay. Okay, good. And then I think we're all aligned, right? Okay. So can I just ask Mamanta, right? Okay, it is, right? So what's your role going to be, if I may ask? Yes, I will be front-ending all the applications under F&R. I'll be reporting into Sudhir more from the delivery side and governance for us. And in particular, to this data co-partner? To the service credit, no, I'll be responsible for everything getting delivered out under F&R. Okay. So she's taking on a more broader role for F&R domain leadership. So she'll be working closely with me. Okay, so not directly involved here, right? Not directly, but from a governance point of view, she will be kind of, you know, tracking the overall service credit activity, what we are doing, both from effort, impact, and outcomes. So that's something we'll be. Okay, fantastic. Okay, good stuff. Okay, good. This sounds like the dream team to me, but okay. Yeah. Perfect. We have the dream team, absolutely. Exactly, this is the dream team. It looks like it. Vik, as I've got eyes on you to get me that data model, right, at the moment. Yeah, I can feel you're going to play the role of Superman over here. Cool. I'll try my best. So you have Archana on the WPC side, you have Vikas on this side. So he is at home on this side of the world. Archana is more at home on the P&H side of the world. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

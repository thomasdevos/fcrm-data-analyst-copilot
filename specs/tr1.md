Let's see who organized this session, I need it. Hey, good morning everybody, how are we doing? Good. Fantastic. Honey, you organized the meeting, do you want to wait for somebody else to join? Yeah, we're waiting for Sudhir and Shambhik to join. Okay. Honey, maybe we can kick start. Sudhir and Shambhik will join us. Babaji, you want to start? It's too much. Sudhir is here. Hi Sudhir. Hi, good morning. So sorry I'm late. Morning Arthur. Good morning. Yes, so shall we dive right away into the next steps or do we need any context? Anyone in the call? I think everyone is aware of the context, right? So we have had, so Arthur, so quickly for your benefit, so further in continuation with the conversation we had. So I think a couple of approaches, scope, definition, etc. we have done. I think a couple of things we need to nail down right now. Is are we going to do it outside or do something outside and come back inside? And especially if you are doing it outside, how do we go about on the data? I think that's a question that's open and I think there is one more element open on the ITRM side that will probably take it up towards the second half of the session, right? So I have invited all the right people here. I also wanted to introduce you to Mamta who is stepping in into the finance and risk area and you will see her collaborating regularly. Hi Arthur. Nice to meet you Mamta. Hi. And I think others you are already familiar with. Vamsi, you have met him on the sides of the advisory project because you are familiar, right? And Thomas, you have met him on the workshops. Excellent. So Thomas, may I request you to lead the conversation please? Yes, sure I can do that. I started preparing something over here, what I think it is, obviously on the back of our conversation, right? So perhaps maybe we need to kind of change this a little bit, right? So I think a scope, I think, Arthur, right? I mean, I know I send you a document, so the document is almost a mirror of what you see over here on my screen, okay? I think there were two key statements being made in that particular document, right? Can I record this one? Yeah, yeah, fine, record. So there were kind of two key functionalities, Arthur, in kind of the scope over here. And I think you took an action away to go and validate precisely what we want to do. Was this more kind of summarization, decisioning, kind of, and aiding the analyst, right? Or was it actually triaging as well, right? So what was the outcome of that particular conversation there, Arthur? Do you have any more insights on this? It's only aiding the assistant, so no triage. So this, okay. Good. And in aiding, now we propose to build an AI assistant as well, right? So we can get more detailed type of feedback as well. Is that kind of still on the radar? Is that being dropped as well at the same time? I'm not sure what you mean by with an AI assistant. So basically you can interrogate the transactions, right? Or the case, yeah? I think in your original proposal, I thought you said that would be for a later phase. Since we dropped the agent now, and if we can include it, I think that would be great. Okay. Maybe it's worthwhile I bring up kind of the latest kind of document, right? That I shared, right? So then at least you can see this one, right? So this is kind of what we, let me see, proposed, right? Kind of the autonomous kind of data gathering, right? You can see that on my screen now. That's a bit too small, I guess. Let me go back. The autonomous data gathering, right? That's kind of an agent is going to use a tool and we're going to access a copy of the FCRM kind of database, right? Except that you're not allowed to use an agent. Say again? Except that you're not allowed to use an agent. All right. Okay. That's the conversation I had with Sudhir, which I want to get confirmation over here. Okay. So an agent is obviously intelligence is backed by kind of a model, a large language model, right? So what you're saying is, yes, we can get the case ID from the SQL database, basically. That's what we're saying, right? But no further intelligence. You mean in the data? Because I thought you were going to present a webpage where the alert handler is going to enter the case ID. Yeah. And how to link it to the data, right? Yeah, that's right. That's what I mean. So we've got a case ID. I don't think we've decided yet on where to get the data from. Of course, the production system is in Microsoft SQL database, but I think it will be difficult to make that connections. Alternative solutions is that we use the data that we have already on the digital analytics platform, DAP in ING, which has a different structure. It's not the FSTM database. Or that we generate mock data and that also we can decide on the format, right? Okay. Well, last time we said we're going to get a copy, right? Yeah, but a lot has changed since because I've been asking around what is not possible. Okay. Okay. So for the MVP, we might be mocking the data. That's what you're saying, right? Yeah, that choice we still need to make. And the outcome is as well, let's not use an AI agent. Can I ask you what the rationale behind that is? Yeah. And in ING, we have an approval board for all the AI initiatives and especially the agentic initiatives. And currently they're running a proof of concept on agentic AI for mortgages. And they want to wait for the outcome for that before they start any other agentic projects, even if it's just a POC. Okay. Okay. So two questions here. So Arthur, you had also suggested that you will probably consult with Joan and confirm. So that's done, right? So it's pretty much in case. Yes. So one request to either Chitra or Vamsi, the technical definition of what we are going to do and what approach we are taking, if you can please document, it will help us, you know, relate to, because I think Thomas is presenting, so he may not be able to take notes. Just, yeah. Thanks. So for everybody, of course, the next step could be to use an agent. I also would like to use an agent, but for now I'm not allowed to try. Okay. Vamsi? So yeah, Arthur, just to make, you know, my first meeting, sorry if it's a basic question, but typically the agent is something, it can take a, you know, based on some reasoning analytics, it can take a decision on its own, that is agent, whereas a simple generative AI is something which takes the input, uses a model, but we are completely driving. There is no autonomous action or anything that is in picture. That is what we call it a generative AI solution, right? So here, though we are using the word agent, it is not going to take any action on its own. It is simply gathering the data, pushing it to the model, and getting the natural language or, you know, an English conversational summary. Do you still want to call that as an agent and it is allowed or not allowed? I don't know what the definition of an agent is in IMG, so let me then connect somebody that can explain to you. AI is allowed, so that's not a problem. So I don't know what, there seems to be different definitions of agents now. I don't know what is the correct definition. I'll let you know what's in my mind now, right, after I've heard what Artur said, right? We drop agent, right, more the definition what Vamsi is saying from kind of the autonomous data gathering. I'm just going to call it data gathering. We're going to get a case idea. We do a simple SQL lookup, very straightforward kind of query, basically the database A. Secondly, you're assuming it's going to be a SQL database. I said that's not decided yet. Okay, I just go back from our previous conversation. Some kind of a lookup, right? Somehow, right? Okay, so, but secondly, we have an AI assistant and that's going to use obviously AI, but not an agent, not reasoning. It's just kind of summarization, basically. That's a point to number two of it, and as far as I understand, Artur, that's allowed, right? That is an AI assistant, right? Okay, fine, and that can now make proposals and recommendations, right? And I think when we get to proposals, I think when I spoke with Sudhir, maybe on the back of your conversation there, is an analyst needs to close, right, kind of the more, I don't want to use it about triaging, but kind of the case almost and come up with a report. Do we want also to create a report to aid the analyst to kind of close kind of the case, post his findings? Because that's a typical use case of, let's say, Gen AI, right? It's very good at obviously creating these kind of proposals and reports. I would say for now, no. Okay, okay, fine. Okay, that's good. But we are now starting, so for me, one of the first things is we should set up a meeting with the business analyst to gather all the functional requirements, so we know what is in scope and what is not in scope. I think we should have two streams, one to get the functional requirements, and the other one to decide on how we do the technical implementation. And then hopefully in one or two weeks, we should bring that together and start building something. I think maybe one or two weeks is probably too optimistic because we still have to request projects and all kind of stuff. There is some loops we need to jump through. Okay, and perhaps maybe that goes to the next point, right? Where precisely do we want to start building this POC, right? If it's synthetic data, obviously we can do this almost anywhere, right? If, right? So what's your recommendation? What's your, at this moment in time, I would prefer to do this on the ING kind of estate. Yeah, that's all my preference still, so I want to try to go that route. But as I do not have confirmation yet that it is allowed, we have to have a plan B. And if it is ING, would it be, I guess, on GCP, right? Yes, for sure. Okay, for sure. So I want to get started, right? After that's my personal aim, ASAP. What we possibly could do is we could start the POC on our side, right? Okay, we can start building kind of the foundational components. Once we have the decision, we can transpose the footing. Right, and I mean, to me, what I'm trying to tell you is it's not a blocker, right? But we need to know something within this, a week or two weeks maximum, I would say, what the approach would be, right? We can do an assessment of discovery and so on and so forth, a little bit more, right? I think we should have to start with then a session with the functional requirements because then we can identify already the data points and you can already generate a mock data set on your side that you can start working on. Yeah, do you know if it's the standard kind of data model that's deployed on FCRM or is it being customized for ING? No, it's standard. It's standard. You guys correct me if I'm wrong. You know better than I. I would say it's standard, right? Yes, that's right, yes. Okay, so in that case, I think I have a good understanding what it looks like. So we can build this, let's say, or we can, I mean, create a schema. Again, you do for the FCRM part, but our users are using something, what they call a CDT, case disposition template, and that also gathers data from additional sources and we would like to include that as well because it helps the decision making. Okay, can I give Vikas maybe a piece of work to do, right? To get this, let's say, that data model to us, right? And at least we're aligned. We're not going to go in two different directions, right? On business side, Upendra is involved. I guess you know him, right? As a business analyst. Have I seen him yet? No, I'm asking Vikas. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've met Upendra. Yeah, I know who he is. So Vikas, if I can ask you to kind of help us, right, please. Okay, to get us, let's say, the data model and so on and so forth, whatever we need in terms of the inputs, that would be good. Then we can get started on our side, right? Yeah? Sure, sure. Okay, good. Good. Do we want to go further to kind of the thing I brought up first there as well, or perhaps maybe not? I'm not sure. Let me just see if there's anything else on here that we need to discuss. The timeline we already discussed, so perhaps maybe for the people on the call over here, the first thing we want to do is in kind of the first week or two, right? I guess finalizing the scope a little bit more, the requirements more, and set up environments, right? And including obviously what we just discussed around kind of the data model and maybe the data contracts and these type of things as well. And we're going to focus to start with on compliance and risk as well, right? So after that, I need to change this now because we're not going to use a kind of an agent anymore. So after that, we're going to do a bit of infra work, right? And we're going to work on guardrails there as well. So I think I reworked this one and I shared a revised version as well. Then from a technology perspective, we did agree indeed to use obviously GCP. We're going to use obviously the latest models there as well. We're going to use long chain. We're going to deploy everything in a serverless environment as in Cloud Run, right? That's the idea. This database, that needs to be kind of revalidated, right? That's what we're saying, right? And we're going to use Cloud Functions over here for triggers to update it with new data as well, right? And we're going to deploy everything in VPC with secure service controls there, right? That's kind of the architecture a little bit more kind of in details there as well. Do we have that confirmed anywhere? Because I cannot say if that's good or not. Yeah, that's the recommendation. So we need to get that confirmed indeed. Yeah. Yeah. So once we get officially started, I create a proper GCP kind of architecture. Kind of overview as well, right? So that you- Should our architects confirm that with you, Thomas, or with somebody else? I'll do a first initial proposal, I would say, right? Based upon, I think, what we need to make this successful. Okay? And then if needed, you and I, and maybe you can go to whatever, an architectural design board or something, or whatever it needs to be to get it officially kind of approved. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, because I have the architects on ING side, so I just need to know what we need to link to our managerial side. I'll do an initial proposal, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, good. I think, yeah, squads, I think you know that as well. There are a couple of dependencies. I'll share that separately as well. Yeah, the will be obviously the one in red there, right? That's on the critical part. That's kind of that one offload of FCRM, but that's to be confirmed by yourself, whether that's, yeah, what we're gonna do or not, right? And obviously, that's gonna impact the quality, the accuracy, the coherence level, and the completeness of, let's say, how we can answer these questions and the cases as well, okay? Yeah, to start the project on GCP and to request permission for using Gen-I or for all those things, we have to fill in a lot of forms. Do you have somebody available that can help me with that? Of course, I can help if there's questions on what the input is, but to gather the information and to fill in the forms? Yeah, I'll do kind of the architectural and as part of my job, I think it will be as well, making sure that we can take this through kind of your design board and if that includes filling in forms. Does that have a key? Sorry? I think it would be useful to have somebody that has access to the ING network. Right, okay, I don't have that, so I need to lean probably on some of my colleagues, yeah. Does any of you guys have that here still or not? I mean, Picas, have you been off-boarded? Yeah, because there's... But let me figure that out and confirm the name. Do you think we can off-board somebody again, Sudhir, as part of this initiative? Yes. Is it something like a work package or something? I don't know. So the way it has been constructed is centrally for ING across all domains, it has been constructed one single big work package at a GSPM level, so they are tracking the efforts and we are cross-interlocking. So different domains have taken different approach. Now, based on our decision whether we want to do it outside ING or after on-boarding and inside ING, we may have to on-board or not required to on-board. What I suggest is one of the developers eventually will on-board him or her so that we have both way of synergy that way, irrespective of where we are finally putting up the POC. Let me circle back with a name on that. But is that a precursor for us to move forward to next steps or the next steps can happen in parallel? Depends who's going to do the next steps. If you have somebody that's going to help me, then I think it's a prerequisite. If I have to do everything myself, it will be slower. No, what I meant is, so are we clear? Are we going to do this outside ING or inside ING, the POC? I think we all prefer inside, right? Inside, okay. Then I think on-boarding would be required. I mean, if it's just filling in forms, right? I mean, that can be done, right? Offline, I guess, right? I mean, or outside ING, right? After or now? I think it also requires investigation where to go through. You have to read the conference pages on how the process works. I don't know all of those things yet. Okay. I see. Okay, good. Yeah. So let's have a conversation afterwards and just an individual, right? Okay. Yeah. Okay, good. These were the next steps to me. I think some, yeah, we already have confirmed, I think as well. You can read them over here, talking about obviously your product or kind of rule. There are two as well. That proposal needs to be kind of approved and reviewed by obviously kind of the ING leadership team, I think. And we're talking about the GCP project here as well. That needs confirming and who's going to access as well and the verified kind of the GCP subscriptions as well. So that's all about GCP. And then we have some work to be done. Number three, around compliance and security as well. And then aligning on kind of the explainability requirements as well. But that's going to be part of the assessment and the deep dive on the scoping and the requirements there. Yeah. So, yeah, I thought you said approval on ING site was not required anymore. That's also what I understand from Joan. We can start. What extra approval are you still looking for? You mean in the first item there on the stakeholder alignment? Yes. Now that this has been done, right? So I need to take this off. Review and approve proposal with ING leadership. I thought you said that still needed to be done. In my view, that has been done already. If not, then we need to take action. No, no, no. Like I said, some have been done from what you see on the list over here, right? Indeed, as far as I know, through Sudeer, right? That approval we've got, we've got your confirmation as well. So I think we've got here the analyst as well on the call, which is good. We're having conversation around GCP over here. So that's not yet confirmed fully, right? Okay. But we're having these initial conversations now. But then I think then item number three, there's quite a lot of outstanding there. We're going to hopefully try to close that one during the assessment phase as well around the compliance requirements. So that all needs to be done as well, including the things around security and the architecture and security as well. Yeah. Yeah. For that, there are all the conference pages that explains what we need to do, but I didn't read them yet. Yeah. Perhaps maybe indeed from a document repository. Perspective as in project document repository, right? Perhaps maybe indeed if we can have access to confluence, we can document everything over there rather than sharing Word documents or here kind of microsite. So it would be good to track progress. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It would be really fantastic, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And I think we have defined our squad as well. So that's good. And now we're going to start tracking kind of the service credits as well as part of this. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. Okay. Good. Anything else you can think about, Arthur or Sudhir or anyone else on the call? No, I think it would be good if we can at least onboard one person, to help kick-start everything on ING side. Then I will continue to see if we can get the approvals to make a decision inside or outside ING. We are all aiming for inside. I agree that will be the best. And I think it's also possible. So I don't see a blockers yet. On the functional side, Vikas will connect. I will connect you with Upendra and Tomasz is there in Poland, Vikas. So you can have a session with them to start gathering the functional requirements and the data points. And then we can also see where later where we can get that data from. But I think that's a good first step. And we are going to have a weekly meeting on this now, right Sudhir? Absolutely. We will have that weekly governance. Yeah. So what I was thinking also, I'm still thinking aloud. Let me also circle back after discussion internally with the team. And I think we discussed, right, the person who will be onboarded, the part of his or her efforts will knock it off against the service credit itself, whenever we are working on the specific project. But I think clarity is good. Approvals take, let's say, next couple of days. When do you think we can actually be needing someone to do real technical stuff to start building the? I think as soon as, I would say, mid next week or something, I think. Maybe officially the week after, maybe on a Monday or something like that, right? Give it one week and maybe for Vikas to get some items, right? I refine this one as well. And we get the onboarding maybe sorted as well. So in the meantime, officially we start on the 15th, 16th, the 23rd or something, right? All right. So here's my proposal, Arthur. So I'm just thinking. So I have already identified a developer who will be working on this. He will need to be onboarded. And him, along with Vikas, since Vikas doesn't need any pre-training or familiarization of OrangeShare and all, so he would be probably the best person suited for this. So one plus one combination, we can onboard, yeah? He does. Yeah. And I think he would be having that convenience of being in proximity for you as well. Shall we do that way? Yeah, that would be great. Great. Cool. Let me organize from around the system. OK. Yeah, let me know the names. And I can issue the onboarding also on my side if you want to. It's just that we have to, you have to tell me which work package I need to link it to. I don't know. Yeah, it will not be linked to a specific work package. Let me circle back with that as well. Marian is aware of how to do that. I'll circle back on that. I can also check. But if you can do it, it's fine. Yeah, cool. OK, very good. Sounds good. Good. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you for having me. Thanks a lot. Cool.
